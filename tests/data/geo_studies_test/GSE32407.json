        "psoriasis is a chronic, debilitating, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease. As IFN-\u03b3 is involved in many cellular processes, including activation of T cells and dendritic cells (DCs), antigen processing and presentation, cell adhesion and trafficking, and cytokine and chemokine production, IFN-\u03b3-producing Th1 cells were proposed to be integral to the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Recently, IFN-\u03b3 was shown to enhance IL-23 and IL-1 production by DCs and subsequently induce Th17 cells, important contributors to the inflammatory cascade in psoriasis lesions.  To determine if IFN-\u03b3 indeed induces the pathways leading to the development of psoriasis lesions, a single intradermal injection of IFN-\u03b3 was administered to an area of clinically normal, non-lesional skin of psoriasis patients and biopsies were collected 24 hours later. Although there were no visible changes in the skin, IFN-\u03b3 induced molecular and histological features characteristic of psoriasis lesions.  IFN-\u03b3 increased a number of differentially expressed genes in the skin, including many chemokines concomitant with an influx of T cells and inflammatory DCs. Furthermore, inflammatory DC products TNF, iNOS, IL-23, and TRAIL were present in IFN-\u03b3-treated skin. Thus, IFN-\u03b3, which is significantly elevated in non-lesional skin compared to healthy skin, appears to be a key pathogenic cytokine that can induce the inflammatory cascade in psoriasis."
