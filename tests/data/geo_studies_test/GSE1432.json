        "Microglial cells are resident macrophages in the central nervous system (CNS) and play a pivotal role in the innate and adaptive immune responses against microbial infections. The immune functions of microglia are regulated by a milieu of cytokines including interferon (IFN)-gamma. We here performed a series of experiments to acertain the transcriptional profile of human fetal microglial cells at 1, 6, and 24 h after IFN-gamma treatment.  Primary human microglial cells were either untreated or treated with 200u/ml IFN-gamma.  Affymetrix U133A chips were utilized.  Four different tissue samples (B18, O, W, and Y20) were analyzed at the three time points.",
